# Guess the Number - Game

I use this code for demonstration purposes in my "Hyperproduktiv mit Elixir, Phoenix und Elm" talk.

The code I like most is stored in the branch `both_combined_again`. 

The program is far from perfect - especially the Elixir supervision and crash recovery behaviour have lots of potential for improvement. On the client mostly quality of life improvements are missing.


To start the Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `cd .. && mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
